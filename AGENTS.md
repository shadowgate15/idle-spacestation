You are able to use the Svelte MCP server, where you have access to comprehensive Svelte 5 and SvelteKit documentation. Here's how to use the available tools effectively:

## Available Svelte MCP Tools:

### 1. list-sections

Use this FIRST to discover all available documentation sections. Returns a structured list with titles, use_cases, and paths.
When asked about Svelte or SvelteKit topics, ALWAYS use this tool at the start of the chat to find relevant sections.

### 2. get-documentation

Retrieves full documentation content for specific sections. Accepts single or multiple sections.
After calling the list-sections tool, you MUST analyze the returned documentation sections (especially the use_cases field) and then use the get-documentation tool to fetch ALL documentation sections that are relevant for the user's task.

### 3. svelte-autofixer

Analyzes Svelte code and returns issues and suggestions.
You MUST use this tool whenever writing Svelte code before sending it to the user. Keep calling it until no issues or suggestions are returned.

### 4. playground-link

Generates a Svelte Playground link with the provided code.
After completing the code, ask the user if they want a playground link. Only call this tool after user confirmation and NEVER if code was written to files in their project.

## Project Skill: shadcn-svelte

This project uses shadcn-svelte. When working with shadcn components, styling patterns, installation, theming, or component composition, treat the shadcn-svelte AI reference as the canonical source of truth:

- https://www.shadcn-svelte.com/llms.txt

Guidelines:

- Read that reference before implementing or modifying shadcn-svelte components in this project.
- Prefer shadcn-svelte documentation and APIs over React shadcn/ui guidance or generic examples from other ecosystems.
- Follow shadcn-svelte conventions for CLI usage, `components.json`, theming, Tailwind integration, and component imports.
- If a requested UI pattern maps to an existing shadcn-svelte component, use the documented component and composition pattern from the reference instead of inventing a custom abstraction first.
